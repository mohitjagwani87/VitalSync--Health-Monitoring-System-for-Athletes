## Overview  
VitalSync is an **IoT-powered ECG monitoring system** that captures **ECG data** through sensors, transmits it via **ESP8266**, and displays it on a **web dashboard** using **Python Flask**. The project enables **real-time health tracking**, offering potential applications in remote patient monitoring and AI-based anomaly detection.  

## Hardware Requirements  
- **ESP8266 (NodeMCU)** – WiFi-enabled microcontroller  
- **ECG Sensor (AD8232)** – For real-time heart signal detection  
- **Resistors & Capacitors** – For stable signal processing  
- **Jumper Wires** – For circuit connections  
- **Power Source** – USB power supply for ESP8266  
- **Laptop/PC** – To run the web server and display data  

## Software Requirements  
- **Arduino IDE** – For ESP8266 programming  
- **Python (Flask, Numpy, Matplotlib)** – For web data visualization  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Frontend UI design  
- **GitHub** – For version control  

## How It Works  
1. The **ECG sensor** detects heart signals and transmits data to the **ESP8266**.  
2. The **ESP8266** processes and sends the data via WiFi to a **local IP server**.  
3. The **Flask-based web application** receives, processes, and displays ECG data in real time.  
4. The **web dashboard** presents an intuitive **graphical visualization** of ECG signals.  

## Integration of IoT & Web  
✔ **ESP8266** acts as a bridge between ECG hardware and the web server.  
✔ **Flask backend** processes and displays live ECG data.  
✔ **Real-time ECG visualization** on a custom-designed UI.  
✔ **AI/ML integration (future scope)** for abnormality detection.  

## Impact & Use Cases  
✅ **Remote Patient Monitoring** – Real-time ECG tracking for at-risk patients.  
✅ **Wearable Health Devices** – Potential adaptation into compact devices.  
✅ **AI-Based Diagnostics** – Future integration with ML models for predictive healthcare.  
✅ **Educational Tool** – A great project for learning **IoT & medical tech**.  

## Future Scope  
- **Cloud Integration** – Store ECG data for long-term health analysis.  
- **AI/ML Integration** – Predict cardiac anomalies using deep learning.  
- **Mobile App Development** – Create a companion app for monitoring on the go.  
- **Expanded Sensor Support** – Integration with SPO2, BP sensors, etc.
